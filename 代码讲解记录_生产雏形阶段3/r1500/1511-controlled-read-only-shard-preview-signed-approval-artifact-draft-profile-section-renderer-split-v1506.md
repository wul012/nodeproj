# v1506 code walkthrough

v1506 range closeout: prepares v1482-v1506 tags after code and archive commits are both present.

The changed renderer path is `src/services/controlledReadOnlyShardPreviewSignedApprovalArtifactDraftProfileSectionRenderer.ts`. The main live-window profile sections renderer now delegates the five Signed Approval Capture Artifact Draft sections through the extracted boundary, and the type module catalog records that ownership at order 210.

The verification focus for this step is route-output stability: headings, version markers, and fail-closed false values must remain visible after the split.
