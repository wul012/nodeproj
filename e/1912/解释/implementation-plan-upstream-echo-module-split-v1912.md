# Node v1912 - implementation plan upstream echo module split

## Focus

Move echo verification assembly into Core.

## What changed

Echo verification assembly is now in Core with the digest and profile assembly path.

## Safety and parallelism

This batch only reshapes Node internals around frozen Java v121 and mini-kv v126 evidence, so Java v1604 and mini-kv v1442 can continue in parallel.

## Verification expectation

The batch is covered by typecheck, focused implementation-plan upstream echo verification, forced historical fallback, adjacent implementation-plan/fake-harness regression, build, full Vitest with maxWorkers=6, and GitHub CI after push.
